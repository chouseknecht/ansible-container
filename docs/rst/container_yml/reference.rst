Ansible Container Compose Specification
=======================================

The orchestration document for Ansible Container is the ``container.yml`` file. It's much like a ``docker-compose.yml``
file, defining the services that make up the application, the relationships between each, and how they can be accessed
from the outside world.

The goal for ``container.yml`` is to provide a single definition of the application that defines how to build images,
how to run in development, and how to deploy to a production cloud environment. It's one source of configuration that
works throughout the application lifecycle.

The structure and contents of the file are based on Docker Compose, supporting versions 1 and 2. Looking at a ``container.yml``
file you will recognize it as mostly Compose with a few notable exceptions. There are directives that are not supported,
because they do not translate to the supported clouds, and there are new directives added to support
multi-environment, and multi-cloud configurations.

The aim of this document is to provide a complete reference to ``container.yml``.

Supported Directives
--------------------

.. |checkmark| unicode:: U+02713 .. check mark

The following tables provide a quick references to supported Compose directives. All of the Compose directives for
version 1, 2 and 2.1 are listed along with any directives added by Ansible Container. A |checkmark| in the *Supported?*
column indicates that the directive is supported. In some cases the directive name links to specific implementation notes
that provide details on how the directive is used.


Top level directives

========================== ======================================================== ============

.. _settings:

Settings
--------

The ``settings`` section is an optional dictionary, or mapping, of project level configuration settings. The following
settings are supported:

====================== =====================================================================
Directive              Definition
====================== =====================================================================
project_name           Set the name of the project. Defaults to the basename of the project
                       directory. For built services, project_name is concatenated with service
                       name to form the built image name.

conductor_base         The Conductor container does the heavy lifting, and provides a portable
                       Python runtime for building your target containers. It should be derived
                       from the same distribution as you're building your target containers with.

deployment_output_path The deployment_output_path is mounted to the Conductor container, and the
                       ``run`` and ``deployment`` commands then write generated Ansible playbooks to it.
                       Defaults to ``./ansible-deployment``.
:ref:`k8s_auth`        When deploying to K8s or OpenShift, provide API authentication details.

:ref:`k8s_namespace`   When deploying to a K8s or OpenShift cluster, set the namespace, or project name,
                       in which to deploy the application
====================== =====================================================================

Example
```````

The following is a simple example of a ``settings`` section found in a ``container.yml`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: '2'
    settings:
      conductor_base: 'ubuntu:xenial'
      project_name: myproject

      k8s_namespace:
        name: 'example'
        description: 'Best example ever!'
        display_name: 'Example'

      k8s_auth:
        config_file: /etc/k8s/dev_config
    services:
    ...

Implementation
``````````````

Some of the options within ``settings`` take a dictionary, or mapping, of multiple options. The following provides further
information for these options:

.. _k8s_auth:

k8s_auth
........

The ``k8s_auth`` directive takes a dictionary, or mapping, of options that provide details for
authenticating with the K8s or OpenShift API during the ``run`` command. The following options
are supported:

====================== =====================================================================
Directive              Definition
====================== =====================================================================
config_file            Path to a K8s config file. Defaults to ${HOME}/.kube/config. If
                       no other options are supplied, the config file will be used to
                       authenticate with the cluster API.

context                Name of a context found in the config file.

host                   URL for accessing the API.

api_key                A valid API authentication token.

ssl_ca_cert            Path to a CA certificate file.

cert_file              Path to a certificate file.

key_file               Path to a key file.

verify_ssl             Boolean, indicating if SSL certs should be validated.
====================== =====================================================================

.. _k8s_namespace:

k8s_namespace
.............

Used to set the namespace, or project name, in which the application will be deployed on the cluster.
Specifically, values set here will be passed to the ``k8s_namespace``, or ``openshift_project`` module,
within the Ansible playbook generated by the ``run`` and ``deploy`` commands.

Expects a dictionary, or mapping, with the following attributes:

====================== =====================================================================
Directive              Definition
====================== =====================================================================
name                   The name of the namespace or project. If not provided, defaults to
                       the ``project_name``.

description            A description of the project. Supported only by OpenShift.

display_name           A title, or more formal name, displayed in the OpenShift console.
                       Supported only by OpenShift.
====================== =====================================================================


.. _services:

Services
--------

The ``services`` section is a dictionary, or mapping, of service name to service settings. For example, the following defines
two services, ``web`` and ``db``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: '2'
    services:
      web:
        from: centos:7
        command: [nginx]
        entrypoint: [/usr/bin/entrypoint.sh]
        ports:
          - 8000:8000
        roles:
          - nginx-server
     db:
       from: 'openshift/postgresql:latest'
       expose:
         - 5487

The following table details the attributes, or settings, that can be defined for a service. Only those
with a checkmark in the *Supported* column can be used.

===================== ======================================================== ============

Implementation
``````````````

The following provides details about how specific directives are implemented.

.. _depends_on:

depends_on
..........

Express a dependency between services, causing services to be started in order. Supported by ``build`` and ``run`` commands,
but will be ignored by ``deploy``.

.. _dev_over:

dev_overrides
.............

Use for directives that should only be applied during the execution of the ``run`` command, or development mode. For example,
consider the following ``container.yml`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: '2'
    services:
      web:
        from: centos:7
        command: [nginx]
        entrypoint: [/usr/bin/entrypoint.sh]
        ports:
          - 8000:8000
        dev_overrides:
          ports:
            - 8888:8000
          volumes:
            - ${PWD}:/var/lib/static


In this example, when ``ansible-container run`` is executed, the options found in *dev_overrides* will
take effect, and the running container will have its port 8000 mapped to the host's port 8888, and the host's working
directory will be mounted to '/var/lib/static' in the container.

The ``build`` and ``deploy`` commands ignore *dev_overrides*. When ``build`` executs, the running container
does not have the host's working directory mounted, and the container port 8000 is mapped to the host's port 8000. And
likewise, the ``deploy`` command will create a service using port 8000, and will not create any volumes for the container.

.. _expose:

expose
......

For the ``build`` and ``run`` commands, this exposes ports internally, allowing the container to accept requests from other
containers.

In the cloud, an exposed port translates to a service, and ``deploy`` will create a service for each exposed port. The cloud
service will have the same name as the ``container.yml`` service, will listen on the specified port, and forward requests
to the same port on the pod.

.. _extra_hosts:

extra_hosts
...........

For ``build`` and ``run``, adds a hosts entry to the container.

In the cloud, ``deploy`` will create an External IP service. See `Kubernetes external IPs <http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/#external-ips for details>`_
for details.

.. _links:

links
.....

Links allow containers to communicate directly without having to define a network, and this is supported by the ``build``
and ``run`` commands.

In the cloud, *links* are not supported, and so they will be ignored by ``deploy``. However, containers can communicate
using services, so to enable communication between two containers, add the *expose* directive. See *expose* above.

.. _k8s:

k8s
...

Specify directives specific to the ``k8s`` engine. View :ref:`k8s_openshift_options` for a reference of available directives.


.. _openshift:

openshift
.........

Specify directives specific to the ``openshift`` engine. View :ref:`k8s_openshift_options` for a reference of available directives.

.. _ports:

ports
.....

Connects ports from the host to the container, allowing the container to receive external requests. This is supported by
the ``build`` and ``run`` commands.

The ``deploy`` command supports it as well by mapping the same functionality to the cloud. In the case of Kubernetes it creates
a load balanced service that accepts external requests on the host port and relays them to the pod, which contains the
container, on the container port. In the case of OpenShift it creates a route and service, where the route accepts external
requests on the host port, and relays them to a service listening on the container port, which relays them to a pod also on
the container port.

.. _registries:

registries
..........

Define registries that can be used by the ``push`` and ``deploy`` commands. For each registry, provide a *url*, an optional
*namespace*, and an optional *repository_prefix*. For both *namespace* and *repository_prefix*, if a value is not provided, the project
name is used.

The following is an example taken from a ``container.yml`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    registries:
      google:
        url: https://gcr.io
        namespace: my-project
      openshift:
        url: https://192.168.30.14.xip.io
        namespace: my-project
        repository_prefix: foo

The ``deploy`` command will automatically push images before generating the deployment Ansible playbook. Use the ``--push-to`` option
to specify the registry to which images will be pushed. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Push images and generate the deployment playbook
    $ ansible-container deploy --push-to openshift

In the above example, images will be pushed to *https://192.168.3.14.xip.io/my-project*. Each image will result in a repository name
of *foo-<service-name>*, where *foo* is the *repository_prefix* value for the *openshift* registry. For example, suppose the project
included a service named *web*. The image for it would be pushed to a repository named *foo-web*

You can also use the ``push`` command to push images directly, and bypass the generation of a deployment playbook. The following will
push images to the *google* registry:

.. code-block:: bash

     # Push images
     $ ansible-container push --push-to google

.. _volumes:

volumes
.......

Supported by ``build``, ``run`` and ``deploy`` commands. The volumes directive mounts host paths or named volumes to the container.
In version 2 of compose a named volume must be defined in the top-level volumes directive. In version 1, if a named volume does
not exist, it is automatically created.

In the cloud, host paths result in the creation of an `emptyDir <http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/volumes/#emptydir>`_,
and a named volume will result in the creation of a persistent volume claim (PVC). The resulting emptyDir or PVC will then
be mounted to the container using the specified path.

Ansible Container follows the `Portable Configuration pattern <http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/#writing-portable-configuration>`_,
which means:

- It does not create persistent volumes
- It does create persistent volume claims.

.. _secrets:

secrets
.......

Supported by the ``deploy`` and ``run`` commands. The secrets directive can be used to associate a secret with a container, mounting it as
a volume. Use the top-level :ref:`secrets directive <secrets_top>` to define a secret. To set cloud specific options, view :ref:`k8s_openshift_options`.

.. _volumes_from:

volumes_from
............

Mount all the volumes from another service or container. Supported by ``build`` and ``run`` commands, but not supported
in the cloud, and thus ignored by ``deploy``.


.. _k8s_openshift_options:

k8s and openshift options
-------------------------

When using the ``k8s`` and ``openshift`` engines, the following commands are available for managing cluster objects:

 - deploy
 - restart
 - run
 - stop
 - destroy

To impact how objects are created, a ``k8s`` or ``openshift`` section can be added to a specific service, to a named volume within
the top-level :ref:`volumes directive <volumes_top>`, or to a secret within the top-level :ref:`secrets directive <secrets_top>`.
The following presents an ``openshift`` example:


.. code-block:: yaml

    version: '2'
    services:
      web:
        from: centos:7
        command: [nginx]
        entrypoint: [/usr/bin/entrypoint.sh]
        ports:
          - 8000:8000
        volumes:
            - static-content:/var/www/static
        dev_overrides:
          ports:
            - 8888:8000
          volumes:
            - $PWD:/var/www/static
            - /home/myuser/directory-on-the-host:/var/www/static2
        openshift:
          state: present
          service:
            force: false
          deployment:
            force: false
            replicas: 2
            security_context:
              run_as_user: root
            strategy:
              type: Rolling
              rolling_params:
                timeout_seconds: 120
                max_surge: "20%"
                max_unavailable: "10%"
                pre: {}
                post: {}
          routes:
          - port: 8443
            tls:
            termination: passthrough
            force: false

     volumes:
       static-content:
         openshift:
            state: present
            force: false
            access_modes:
            - ReadWriteOnce
            requested_storage: 5Gi


Service level directives
````````````````````````

The following directives can be added to a ``k8s`` or ``openshift`` section within a service:

======================== =========================================================================================================================
Directive                Definition
======================== =========================================================================================================================
state                    Set to *present*, if the service should be deployed to the cluster, or *absent*, if it should not. Defaults to *present*.
:ref:`service_sub`       Adds a mapping of Service object attributes.
:ref:`deployment_sub`    Adds a mapping of Deployment (or DeploymentConfig for OpenShift) object attributes.
:ref:`route_sub`         Adds a mapping of OpenShift Route object attributes.
:ref:`secrets_sub`       Adds a mapping of OpenShift Secrets object attributes to volume mounts in the deployment.
======================== =========================================================================================================================

.. _service_sub:

service
.......

Service objects expose container ports based on the ``expose`` and ``ports`` directives defined on the service. The ``expose`` directive will result in a Service exposing ports internally, enabling containers to communicate with one another, and ``ports`` will result in a service exposing ports externally, enabling access from outside of the cluster.

Any valid attributes of a Service object can be added to the ``service`` subsection, where they'll be passed through to the resulting Service definition. The only requirement is that attributes be added in snake_case, rather than camelCase. The following demonstrates setting *cluster_ip*, *load_balancer_ip*, *type*, and *annotations*:

.. code-block:: yaml

    openshift:
      service:
        force: false
        cluster_ip: 10.0.171.239
        load_balancer_ip: 78.11.24.19
        type: LoadBalancer
        metadata:
          annotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

By default, existing objects are patched when attributes differ from those specified in ``container.yml``. The patch process is additive, meaning that array and dictionary type values are added to rather than replaced. To override this behavior, and force an update of the object, set the ``force`` option to *true*.

.. _deployment_sub:

deployment
..........

Container objects are created by way of Deployments (or Deployment Configs on OpenShift), and each service will be translated into a Deployment that creates and manages the container.

Any valid attributes of a Deployment object can be added to the ``deployment`` subsection, where they'll be passed through to the resulting Deployment definition. The only requirement is that attributes be added in snake_case, rather than camelCase.

For example, the following shows setting *replicas*, *security_context*, *strategy*, and *triggers*:

.. code-block:: yaml

    openshift:
      deployment:
        force: false
        replicas: 2
        security_context:
          run_as_user: root
        strategy:
          type: Rolling
          rolling_params:
            timeout_seconds: 120
            max_surge: "20%"
            max_unavailable: "10%"
            pre: {}
            post: {}
        triggers:
        - type: "ImageChange"
          image_change_params:
            automatic: true
            from:
              kind: "ImageStreamTag"
              name: "test-mkii-web:latest"
            container_names:
              - "web"

By default, existing objects are patched when attributes differ from those specified in ``container.yml``. The patch process is additive, meaning that array and dictionary type values are added to rather than replaced. To override this behavior, and force an update of the object, set the ``force`` option to *true*.

.. _route_sub:

routes
......

Route objects are used by OpenShift to expose services externally, and Ansible Container generates routes based on the ``ports`` directive of a service.

Consider the following service defined in ``container.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    services:
      web:
        from: centos:7
        entrypoint: ['/usr/bin/entrypoint.sh']
        working_dir: /
        user: apache
        command: [/usr/bin/dumb-init, httpd, -DFOREGROUND]
        ports:
        - 8000:8080
        - 4443:8443

For each port in the set of defined ``ports``, a Route object is generated, and the above will generate the following routes:

.. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Route
    metadata:
      name: web-8000
      namespace: test-mkii
      labels:
        app: test-mkii
        service: web
      spec:
        to:
          kind: Service
          name: web
        port:
          targetPort: port-8000-tcp

.. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersoin: v1
    kind: Route
    metadata:
      name: web-4443
      namespace: test-mkii
      labels:
        app: test-mkii
        service: web
      spec:
        to:
          kind: Service
          name: web
        port: 4443

To add additional options, such as configuring TLS, add the options to the service level `k8s` or `openshift`, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    services:
      web:
        from: centos:7
        entrypoint: ['/usr/bin/entrypoint.sh']
        working_dir: /
        user: apache
        command: [/usr/bin/dumb-init, httpd, -DFOREGROUND]
        ports:
        - 8000:8080
        - 4443:8443
        openshift:
          routes:
          - port: 4443
            tls:
              termination: edge
              key: |-
                -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
                [...]
                -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
              certificate: |-
                -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
                [...]
                -----END CERTIFICATE-----
              caCertificate: |-
                -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
                [...]
                -----END CERTIFICATE-----
            force: false

Notice that ``routes`` is a list. To set the route attributes for a specific port, add a new entry to the list, and set the ``port`` to the host or external port value.

The host port value comes from the ``ports`` directive set at the service level, where a port is in the Docker format of ``host_port:container_port``. Looking back at the first example, the ``web`` service publishes container port 8443 to host port 4443, and thus the route port will be 4443.

With the new options, the route for port 4443 will be updated with the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersoin: v1
    kind: Route
    metadata:
      name: web-4443
      namespace: test-mkii
      labels:
        app: test-mkii
        service: web
    spec:
      to:
        kind: Service
        name: web
      port: 4443
      tls:
        termination: edge
        key: |-
          -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
          [...]
          -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
        certificate: |-
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          [...]
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        caCertificate: |-
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          [...]
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----

.. _secrets_sub:

secrets
.......

Secrets are included in K8s and OpenShift deployments as volume mounts to a container. Consider the following service defined in ``container.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    services:
      web:
        from: centos:7
        entrypoint: ['/usr/bin/entrypoint.sh']
        working_dir: /
        user: apache
        command: [/usr/bin/dumb-init, httpd, -DFOREGROUND]
        ports:
        - 8000:8080
        - 4443:8443
        secrets:
        - apache-certs

For each secret, a ``volumeMount`` object is generated. The above will generate the following during ``deploy`` and ``run``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ...
   template
     spec:
       containers:
         - name: web
           volumeMounts:
             - name: apache-certs
               mountPath: /run/secrets/apache-certs
               readOnly: true

The ``mountPath`` is by default set to the standard Docker location of ``/run/secrets``, and ``readOnly`` defaults to ``true``. Within the  ``k8s`` or
``openshift`` section for the service, set the ``mount_path`` and ``read_only`` attributes of a secret as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    services:
      web:
        from: centos:7
        entrypoint: ['/usr/bin/entrypoint.sh']
        working_dir: /
        user: apache
        command: [/usr/bin/dumb-init, httpd, -DFOREGROUND]
        ports:
        - 8000:8080
        - 4443:8443
        secrets:
        - apache-certs
        openshift:
          state: present
          secrets:
            - name: apache-certs
              mount_path: /etc/httpd/pki/apache-certs
              read_only: false

This will result in:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ...
   template
     spec:
       containers:
         - name: web
           volumeMounts:
             - name: apache-certs
               mountPath: /etc/httpd/pki/apache-certs
               readOnly: false

.. _volumes_top:

Volumes
```````

For Docker, the service level ``volumes`` directive works as expected. The top-level ``volumes`` directive, however, has been modified slightly. The following example ``container.yml`` shows the three forms of the service level ``volumes`` directive, and the new top-level ``volumes`` format:

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: '2'
    services:
      web:
        from: centos:7
        entrypoint: [/usr/bin/entrypoint.sh]
        working_dir: /
        user: apache
        command: [/usr/bin/dumb-init, httpd, -DFOREGROUND]
        ports:
        - 8000:8080
        - 4443:8443
        roles:
        - apache-container
        volumes:
          - /Users/chouseknecht/projects/test-mkii/static:/var/www/static
          - static-content:/var/www/static2
          - /var/www/static3

    volumes:
      static-content:
        docker: {}
        k8s:
          force: false
          state: present
          access_modes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
          requested_storage: 1Gi
          metadata:
            annotations: 'volume.beta.kubernetes.io/mount-options: "discard"'

The top-level directive is organized by volume name. In this case, a volume named ``static-content`` is mounted to the container as ``/var/www/static2``. The definition of the named volume is found in the top-level ``volumes`` directive under the name, where specific options are organized by container engine. In this case there are no options for ``docker``, and several options for ``openshift``.

Under ``docker``, add valid volume attributes including: driver, driver_opts and external. For additional information about Docker volumes see Docker's `volume configuration reference <https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#volume-configuration-reference>`_.


For ``openshift`` and ``k8s``, the following options are available:

======================== =============================================================================================================================
Directive                Definition
======================== =============================================================================================================================
metadata                 Provide a metadata mapping, as depicted above. In general, the only mapping value
                         provided here would be ``annotations``.
access_modes             A list of valid `access modes <http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/#access-modes>`_.
match_labels             A mapping of key:value pairs used to filter matching volumes.
match_expressions        A list of expressions used to filter matching volumes.
                         See `Persistent Volume Claims <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims>`_ for
                         additional details.
requested_storage        The amount of storage being requested. Defaults to 1Gi.
                         See `compute resources <http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/compute-resources/>`_ for abbreviations.
